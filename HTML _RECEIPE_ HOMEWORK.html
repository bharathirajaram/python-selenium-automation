    <H2>Instructions</H2>
        <ol type="1" >
            <li>.Vegetables which take more time to cook are to be chopped in small sizes like carrots, potatoes, etc.
            </li>



            <li>Take 1 to 1.5 cups chopped vegetables in a pan or pot. Also add 6 to 7 pearl onions or 1 small to medium onion (thickly sliced) and 1 small to medium tomato (quartered).
            </li>


            <li>Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, ¼ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder and salt as per taste.

Adding kashmiri red chili powder is optional and can be skipped. I add it for a nice bright color in the sambar.

            </li>


            <li>Add 1.5 to 2 cups water and stir. Add enough water so that they cover the vegetables.

            </li>

            <li>Keep the pan on a stove top and begin to cook vegetables on a medium-low to medium heat. In between do check when the vegetables are cooking.

            </li>


            <li>Cook till the vegetables are almost done. Ensure that you don’t overcook the vegetables.

            </li>


            <li>Add the prepared tamarind pulp to the cooked vegetables. If you don’t have dried tamarind then use packaged or bottled tamarind paste.

You can add about ½ to 1 tablespoon of the tamarind paste or add as according to your taste.

            </li>


            <li>Add the mashed dal.

            </li>


            <li>Cover the pan with its lid for 4 to 5 minutes, so that the aroma and flavors from the tempering mixture get infused with the sambar.

            </li>


            <li>Serve sambar hot or warm. Garnish with some coriander leaves if you prefer. Usually, it is is cooked a two-three hours earlier as its taste becomes better with time.

However, we prefer sambar to be served as soon as it is made. It can also be served with steamed rice, idli, dosa, medu vada or uttapam.
